# make3Dme

This doesnt exist yet, the plan is to take Blender and an existing viable human creation addon like MBLab or MakeHuman, create a character customisation UI that shows Blender's Evee render output and a set of abstracted settings to the human creation addon, hiding the entire blender interface except that UI. The UI will probably be built as a blender addon, and the final application will be a nicely bundled preconfigured portable Blender executable.

It would also be ideal if it can output to:
- the VRM format, so it plays well with sync3Dme & vrkspace. 
- VRChat's avatar format

If your looking for something for anime character generation, this is probably the one place where that is not our priority. 
We are aiming for realism to start with, and personality expression through clothing and hair.
We also want to incorporate a addon system, so that your real life physical characterisitcs, no matter how unique can be replicated for your virtual self if you so desire. This could be changes or removal to limbs, wheel chairs, congenital disorders, birth marks etc, it should all options for you to decide, though this will have to pickup a large community before it can account for everyone.
